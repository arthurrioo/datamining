# Datamining Project - IBMEC

Hello readers! 

We are a group of College students, majoring in Economics, that will be trying and testing some econometric models in Python, with the focus on Oil exports of Brazil!

Today we are using a Database from the IBGE, or the institute of Brazilian Statistics, and COMEX, short for Exterior Commerce (or if translated ExCom, funny how portuguese is the complete inverse of English)
 
If you are a native or speaks Portuguese, you can read all of our analysis and reports made for our Class in the link below:
